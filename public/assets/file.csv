Respect for the word - to employ it with scrupulous care and an incorruptible heartfelt love of truth - is essential if there is to be any growth in a society or in the human race.  - Dag Hammarskjold
To misuse the word is to show contempt for man. It undermines the bridges and poisons the wells. It causes Man to regress down the long path of his evolution.  - Dag Hammarskjold
"The UN is not just a product of do-gooders. It is harshly real. The day will come when men will see the U.N. and what it means clearly. Everything will be all right -- you know when? When people, just people, stop thinking of the United Nations as a weird Picasso abstraction, and see it as a drawing they made themselves.  - Dag Hammarskjold"

Your cravings as a human animal do not become a prayer just because it is God whom you ask to attend to them.  - Dag Hammarskjold

"The body politic has to step away from its own militarization and understand we're gonna survive in the future by our capacity to make common cause with as many other people as we can. The big issues facing us are the ones that demand a kind of global unanimity if we have any hope of survival. Climate change and health issues are not going to be solved by armies. As long as we relate to the rest of the world just through militaries, we're not gonna be able to grapple with the issues that are really gonna kill us.  - David Harris"
It is never safe to look into the future with eyes of fear.  - E. H. Harrison

What I thought was an end turned out to be a middle.  - Tony Hoagland
An Empty sort of mind is valuable for finding pearls and tails and things because it can see what's in front of it. An Overstuffed mind is unable to.  - Benjamin Hoff
"While the Clear mind listens to a bird singing, the Stuffed-Full-of-Knolwdge-and-Cleverness mind wonders what kind of bird is singing. The more Stuffed Up it is, the less it can hear through its own ears and see through it own eyes. Knowledge and Cleverness tend to concern themselves with the wrong sort of things, and a mind confused by Knowledge, Cleverness and Abstract Ideas rends to go chasing off after things that don't matter, or that don't even exist, instead of seeing, appreciating, and making use of what is right in front of it.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"Let's consider Emptiness in general for a moment. What is it about a Taoist landscape painting that seems so refreshing to so many different kinds of people? The Emptiness, the space that's not filled in. What is it about fresh snow, clean air, pure water? Or good music? As Claude Debussy expressed it, “Music is the space between the notes.”  - Benjamin Hoff"
"Like silence after noise, or cool, clear water on a hot stuff day, Emptiness cleans out the messy mind and charges up the batteries of spiritual energy.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"Many people are afraid of Emptiness, however, because it reminds them of Loneliness. Everything has to be filled in, it seems – appointment books, hillsides, vacant lots – but when all the spaces are filled, the Loneliness really begins. Then the Groups are joined, the Classes are signed up for, and the Gift-to-Yourself items are bought. When the Loneliness starts creeping in the door, the Television Set is turned on to make it go away. Bu it doesn't go away. So some of us do instead, and after discarding the emptiness of the Big Congested Mess, we discover the fullness of Nothing.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"… In the forty-eighth chapter of the Tao Te Ching, Lao-tse wrote, “To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day.”  - Benjamin Hoff"
"… Gathering, analyzing, sorting and storing information – these functions and more the mind can perform so automatically, skillfully, and effortlessly that it makes the most sophisticated computer look like a plastic toy by comparison. But it can do infinitely more. To use the mind as it's all too commonly used, on the kinds of things that it's usually used on, is about as inefficient and inappropriate as using a magic sword to open up a can of beans. The power of a clear mind is beyond description. But it can be attained by anyone who can appreciate and utilize the value of Nothing.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"Let's say you get an idea – or, as Pooh would more accurately say, it gets you. Where did it come from? From this something, which came from that something? If you are able to trace it all the way back to its source, you will discover that it came from Nothing. And chances are, the greater the idea, the more directly it came from there. “A strike of genius! Completely unheard of! A revolutionary new approach!” Practically everyone has gotten some sort of an idea like that sometime most likely after a sound sleep when everything was so clear and filled with Nothing that an Idea suddenly appeared in it. But we don't have to fall asleep for a few hours for that to happen. We can be awake, instead – completely awake. The process is very natural.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"It starts when we are children, helpless but aware of things, enjoying what is around us. Then we reach adolescence, still helpless but trying to at least appear independent. When we outgrow that stage, we become adults – self-sufficient individuals able and mature enough to help others as we have learned to help ourselves.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"But the adult is not the highest stage of development. The end of the cycle is that of the independent, clever-minded, all-seeing Child. That is the level known as wisdom. When the Tao Te Ching and other wise books say things like, “Return to the beginning; become a child again,” that's what they're referring to. Why do the enlightened seem filled with light and happiness, like children? Why do they sometimes even look and talk like children? Because they are. The wise are Children Who Know. Their minds have been emptied of the countless minute somethings of small learning, and filled with the wisdom of the Great Nothing, the Way of the Universe.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"… the Pooh books come to an end, in the Enchanted Place at the top of the Forest. We can go there at any time. It's not far away; it's not hard to find. Just take the path to Nothing, and go Nowhere until you reach it. Because the Enchanted Place is right where you are, and if you're Friendly With Bears, you can find it.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"Cleverness, as usual, takes all the credit it possibly can. But it's not the Clever Mind that's responsible when things work out. It's the mind that sees what's in front of it, and follows the nature of things.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"When you work with Wu Wei, you put the round peg in the round hole and the square peg in the square hole. No stress, no struggle. Egotistical Desire tries to force the round peg into the square hole and the square peg into the round hole. Cleverness tries to devise craftier ways of making pegs fit where they don't belong. Knowledge tries to figure out why round pegs fit round holes, but not square holes. Wu Wei doesn't try. It doesn't think about it. It just does it. And when it does, it doesn't appear to do much of anything. But Things Get Done.  - Benjamin Hoff"
Cleverness...has its limitations.  - Benjamin Hoff
"How can you get very far, if you don't know who you are? How can you do what you ought, if you don't know what you've got? And if you don't know which to go of all the things in front of you, then what you'll have when you are through is just a mess without a clue of all the best that can come true if you know what and which and who.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"In the sixty-seventh chapter of the Tao Te Ching, Lao-tse names it as his “first treasure,” and then wrote, “From caring comes courage.” We might add that from it also comes wisdom. It's rather significant, we think, that those who have no compassion have no wisdom. Knowledge, yes; cleverness, maybe; wisdom, no.  A clever mind is not a heart. Knowledge doesn't really care. Wisdom does. We also consider it significant the cor, the Latin word for “heart”, is the basis for the word courage.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"In the story of the Ugly Duckling, when did the Ugly Duckling stop feeling Ugly? When he realized that he was a Swan. Each of us has something Special, a Swan of some sort, hidden inside somewhere. But until we recognize that it's there, what can we do but splash around, treading water? The Wise are Who They Are. They work with what they're got and do what they can do.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"There are things about ourselves that we need to get rid of; there are things we need to change. But at the same time, we do not need to be too desperate, too ruthless, too combative. Along the way to usefulness and happiness, many of those things will change themselves, and the others can be worked on as we go. The first thing we need to do is recognize and trust our Inner Nature, and not lose sight of it. For within the Ugly Duckling is the Swan, inside the Bouncy Tigger is the Rescuer who knows the Way, and in each of us is something Special, and that we need to keep.  - Benjamin Hoff"
...everything has its own place and function.  - Benjamin Hoff
"Once you face and understand your limitations, you can work with them, instead of having them work against you and get in your way, which is what they do when you ignore them, whether you realize it or not. And then you will find that, in many cases, your limitations can be your strengths.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"Sooner or later, we are bound to discover some things about ourselves that we don't like.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"But once we see they’re there, we can decide what we want to do with them. Do we want to get rid of them completely, change them into other things, or use them in beneficial ways? The last two approaches are often especially Useful, since they avoid head-on conflict, and therefore minimize struggle. Also, they allow those transformed characteristics to be added to the list of things we have that help us out.  - Benjamin Hoff"
"In a similar manner, instead of struggling to erase what are referred to as negative emotions, we can learn to use them in positive ways. We could describe the principle like this: while pounding on the piano keys may produce noise, removing them doesn't exactly further the creation of music. The principles of Music and Living aren't all that different....  - Benjamin Hoff"
"So rather than work against ourselves, all we need to do in many cases is to point our weaknesses or unpleasant tendencies in a different direction than we have been.  - Benjamin Hoff"
...there is more to knowing than just being correct.  - Benjamin Hoff

Anger is the prelude to courage.  - Eric Hoffer
My mother was not like other mothers.  But all the things I used to resent her for I admire her for now.  - Alice Hoffman

A ship in port is safe but that's not what ships are for...sail out to see and do new things.  - Grace Murray Hopper
You manage things; you lead people.  - Grace Murray Hopper
"The older theology tended to produce character.  By the end of the 2oth century, we have becomes God’s demanding little brats.  In church, we must be entertained.  Our emotions must be charged.  We must be offered amusing programs.  We give up a lot to become Christians and what little teaching we do get must cater to our pragmatic, self-centered interests.  Preaching must be filled with clever anecdotes and colorful illustrations with nothing more than passing references to doctrine.  I want to know what this means for me in my daily experience.  Have we forgotten that God is a monarch?  His the king by whom and for whom all things were made and by whose sovereign power they are sustained.  We exist for His pleasure, not He for ours.  We are on this earth to entertain Him, please Him, adore Him, bring Him satisfaction, excitement and joy.  Any gospel that seeks to answer the question, “What in this for me?” has it all backwards.  The question is, “What’s in it for God?”  - Mike Horton"
We cannot feel like Christians or act like Christians if we don't think like Christians.  - Mike Horton
Honesty is not a policy…it is a state of mind or it isn't honesty.  - Eugene L'Hote

The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is practice.  - Vladimir Horowitz
A soul suffocated by fear leaves too many joys unlived.  - Maria Housden
"Compassion does not feel sorry in the face of suffering; it knows that all suffering is its own.  When we recognize this connection between us and everyone else, we know that we belong to each other; we do not suffer alone.  - Maria Housden"
"Faith is not about believing but about letting go of beliefs.  Faith does not hope and pray for things to be different sometime in the future.  Faith is the still heart that refuses nothing, our willingness to trust things as they are.  - Maria Housden"
"Home…is the rightness you feel, WHEREVER you are, when you know that you are loved.  - Maria Housden"
"Truth is fierce and unrelenting.  We cannot change it, but we CAN change the way we live it.  Making mistakes, not being loved and dying are inescapable experiences of being human; so is our fear of them.  By facing those fears, we have a chance to step beyond them.  When we are willing to do the best we can with what we know, to be honest with ourselves and others about who we are and what really matters to us, only then are the lives we live and the love we receive truly our own.  - Maria Housden"

How a person masters his fate is more important that what his fate is.  - Wilhelm Karl Von Humboldt
"However great an evil immorality may be, we must not forget that it is not without its beneficial consequences. It is only through extremes that men can arrive at the middle path of wisdom and virtue.  - Wilhelm Karl Von Humboldt"

My grandmother's mother came to her with a well-worn coat and told her to hide it from the Cossacks. So she did.  - Janis Ian

   My grandmother's sister same to her and told her to sew the coins into the lining of the coat and hide it from the Cossacks. So she did.  - Janis Ian

"   And her grandmother said, “You are a Jew. If you ever have to flee this country because of it, you will need something to bargain with during the journey.” And one day she did.  - Janis Ian"

"I've heard people say that forgiveness is for wimps.  Well, I say then that they must never have tried it.  Forgiveness is hard work.  It demands diligent self-discipline, constant corralling of our basest instincts, custody of the tongue, and a steadfast refusal not to get caught up in the mean-spiritedness of our times.  It does not mean we forget, we condone, or we absolve responsibility.  It does mean that we let go of hate, that we try to separate the loss and the cost from the recompense or punishment we deem is due.  - Marietta Jaeger"
"If the idea is good, then add very hard work.  - Richard James"

Alternative responses to take you from fear to accomplishment: I hope -- I know; I can't -- I won't; If only -- next time; I should -- I could -- It's not my fault -- I'm totally responsible; It's a problem -- It's an opportunity; I'm never satisfied -- I want to learn and grow; Life's a struggle -- Life's an adventure; It's terrible -- It's a learning experience; What will I do? -- I'll handle it.  - Susan Jeffers
"Five truths about fear: 1 - The fear will never go away as long as you continue to grow. 2 - The only way to get rid of the fear of doing something is to go out and…do it. 3 - The only way to feel better about yourself is to go out and…do it. 4 - Not only are you afraid when facing the unknown, so is everyone else. 5 - Pushing through fear is less frightening than living with the bigger underlying fear that comes from a feeling of helplessness.  - Susan Jeffers"

"After all, I don't see why I am always asking for private, individual, selfish miracles when every year there are miracles like white dogwood.  - Anne Morrow Lindbergh"
"A friend of mine talks with real concern about “the medicalization of human experience,” a process by which more and more of the inevitable results of living our lives over time are perceived as medical disorders requiring medical responses and increasingly costly medical and pharmaceutical “treatments.”  I think she has a point, though I know there are miraculous drugs in our time and some of them ensure the survival of people I love, not to mention my own.  I am grateful for every one of them.  But the suspicion that new “diseases” are being created in order to sell new products gives me the creeps, and I resent being told that what happens to my body as it ages is something “wrong” that needs pharmaceutical fixing.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"I don’t want to be fixed, pharmaceutic-ally or otherwise.  I’m not any more tempted by that weight-loss pill than by the one I could take when I’m sleepy, instead of taking a nap.  If I want to lose weight I can eat less and exercise more..  That always works.  And naps?  I like naps.  I plan to take more and more of them as I grow old, dozing off in my rocking chair with my spectacles slipping slowly down over the bridge of my nose and my knitting needles falling from my fingers (assuming I remember how to knit, something I haven’t done for yeas).  I think an anti-napping pill is a horrible idea….  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"I’m looking for some balance between chemistry and philosophy, as I go one and on.  I would love to grow old with as little pain and discomfort as possible, and to remain healthy for as long as I can.  To that end, as I feel the need for pharmaceutical assistance, I’ll surely accept it.  I like drugs.  I always have. Why change now?  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"But I don’t want to be duped into buying expensive and potentially damaging drugs that I don’t need, and I agree with my mother-in-law that some medications do more harm than good.  Despite my own willingness to take pills for epilepsy, anxiety, depression, and diarrhea, I cannot believe that any drug manufactured or grown can produce that sense of well-being I have during those moments when, with all my aches and ailments, I am suddenly, acutely conscious of being alive: on a spring morning when the first V of wild geese flies over the farm; any time I see one of my children again after a separation; whenever I look out over the hills and pastures. Or up at the stars.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"I’m convinced that what we really need most to sustain us as we grow older, more than any drug on the market, is this kind of appreciative awareness, along with compassion, a sense of humor, and simple common sense.  Side effects will include a certain amount of pain, a fair share of sorrow, recurring doses of discomfort great and small, and an immeasurable, priceless quantity of peace of mind.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"At first, it seemed ridiculous.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"Certain combinations of drugs are like certain combinations of personalities: great to work with individually, impossible together.  To forget this is easy but not wise.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"Everything happens in life.  Some of what happens is terrible.  We know this is true because it has always been true.  But there is another truth available, an inexplicable and sometimes crazy truth that is no less compelling.  The living of a life, day by day and moment by moment, is also wild with joy.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"I keep a journal for many reasons, but the most important one is that I want to be as honest with myself as possible. I think it is very hard to be absolutely honest with oneself, especially if words come easily.  Before I write, I have to ask myself what I think, and if the answer comes too quickly I have to stop and ask again – No, what do I really think?  Words have always served me as a way of organizing my responses to life, which doesn’t necessarily mean that my words have always reflected the truth, not even to me.  But I would like to write more and more truthfully as I grow older.  That means I have to write with great care, I find, and more slowly.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"I think my tendency is to edit thoughts and feelings, and then to form my awareness and memory from the edited version, so that what happens in my life is always acceptable through language: “I was devastated,” “I was furious,” “I was overjoyed,” “I was deeply moved,”  “I was grateful.”  There. It has been described.  It’s finished.  It’s over.  Thank goodness.  Now I can go on with my life.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"   But if I am honest I have to admit that my strong emotions are rarely if ever “finished” and that when I feel them, I feel many at the same time, including some I can’t or don’t dare to express:  Aha!  I always thought my father was crazy!  This proves it! Or even, Gosh! No wonder he was such a pain in the ass!...  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"   The story of the secret families had me raging, thinking, writing, and trying to be honest for about a month.  Then something changed.  On September 4, 2003, I wrote only one sentence in my journal: “God help me, I’m beginning to get used to this!”  It is extraordinary how quickly one can absorb new information, whatever it is.  I still can’t come to a satisfactory conclusion about my father’s secret life; I still feel surges of anger and pain, but not often.  Over the months and years, familiarity overcame shock, and what was once an outrage became another condition of life.  By now, if I’m not “over” the discovery that my father and another life, I am at least used to it.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"   I cannot hang on to moral outrage for very long anyway, however justified it may seem.  So much that goes on in the world is so terrible to contemplate that any family’s scandals and sorrows eventually have to be seen in perspective.  Besides, moral outrage is no fun.  It devours time, monopolizes conversation, and bores other people to tears.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"   For me the emotions wore themselves out, and reason began to creep into my thinking.  However outrageous I may think it, I cannot change the truth of the past, and as time goes on I realize that I have very little to complain about.  The only damage I’ve sustained through these discoveries about my father is in the realm of the imagination.  My old ideas about my personal world are altered.  My family is not exactly as I had thought.  It is different.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"I love to read.  I read not just for education and entertainment but also, I think, as a way of maintaining consistency in the life of my mind.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"My mother taught me, mainly by example, that there is no circumstance in life that excuses bad manners.  - Reeve Lindbergh"
"Those who have never experienced depression have trouble understanding what it is.  I know there are chemical explanations, but they fail to describe what I’ve known.  Depression isn’t like any other feeling I’ve ever had, and it is not at all the same thing as sadness or grief, though depression may come along in the wake of these emotions, a gray, delayed companion.  I think of depression as a kind of influenza of the spirit, a debilitating disease that so weakens and saps the system that it becomes hard to move one’s limbs.  I’ve also thought of it as the heavy fog familiar to people living along the Maine coast and on the islands in Penobscot Bay, weather that rolls in almost imperceptibly until all at once you can’t see a foot in front of you.  Before you know it you are engulfed and directionless, becalmed.  You can only dimly hear the steady, repeating sound of the foghorn far away, guiding other boats to harbor.  - Reeve Lindbergh "
"   Depression is like that.  As when you are sick with flu, or fogged in by weather, you can’t feel the substance and meaning of the world outside yourself, so you tend to curl inward and retreat into your own small package of flesh and bones and blood and breath.  These parts of you are verifiable, and from birth to death, whatever the circumstances, they give comfort.  For me, the fog usually burns off in sunshine as the weather or the season changes.  The flu subsides after a few days or weeks, and life continues.  - Reeve Lindbergh"

"By allowing myself to be carried by every restless wave in the sea of my emotions, I always lived in a very unstable place.  Nothing was ever my fault.  Everything always “just happened” to me.  Therefore, I could play the role of a victim who had no responsibility to change....No matter what emotions surface, I'm the only one responsible for how I react to them.  So as long as I keep choosing to be controlled by my feelings of anxiety, sadness, depression, anger, or bitterness, I don't get to blame anyone by myself.  Since I alone select how I feel, I can't complain about something that I can choose to change every moment of every day....Mia has proved with her life that my current difficult circumstance aren't nearly as important as what I decide to do with them.  How I act in these challenging situations determines who I really am and what I really believe.  When I view my life from that perspective, it's far easier for me to focus on what I should do instead of on what I think I should have. I can either focus on complaining about my hardships or I can decide to allow each challenge to help me grow up.  I think it's ironic that it took an animal, my little dog, to teach me how to behave, how to take responsibility for how I feel....circumstances don't dictate how I feel – I do.  I can always choose my attitude.  I can always choose joy.  - Kim Meeder"

Before my eyes, Mia has demonstrated that it doesn't matter if I can see what lies ahead of me.  It only matters that I trust, believe, and listen to the God who does....It was time for me to believe that no matter how far I had fallen away from God, there was no darkness so deep that I could fall beyond His willingness to be my light.  - Kim Meeder"
My precious grandmother taught me that kind thoughts are wasted if they don't become kind words.  - Kim Meeder

"...The grass isn't greener on the other side – it's greener where you water it!  It's greener where contentment flows. She reminds us to stop wishing for what we don't have and start caring for what we do!  My little dog taught me how much less energy it takes to rejoice in what I do have than to be resentful about what I don't.  When we choose joy, our problems don’t go away, but our sorrow, loneliness, and low self-esteem do.  - Kim Meeder"
"We get to choose whether our hardships will ruin us – or refine us....Growing through a time of unbearable stress can help you understand the true value of peace.  By choosing to work through resentment and an unwillingness to forgive, we can learn a greater depth of forgiveness and love....Every hardship we face is an opportunity to either break down or break through.  We choose the outcome. For each difficulty we struggle with, we decide if it will make us weaker or stronger.  - Kim Meeder"
"Your control? Honestly, what do we control?  When is the last time you told your heart to beat? Or your eyes to see?  How often do we direct the rhythm of our breathing? The only thing we actually do control in the life is the ability to choose our attitude, our beliefs. The truth about our being “in control” is that it is an illusion we want to believe is real.  - Kim Meeder"

"   Why? It's so unfair. We know what works! It's not speculation any more. The rules that created America work. Limited government, rule of law, and economic freedom.  - John Stossel"
"   Limited government is key, but not sufficient. Millions live in misery because nations don't have enough government. Entrepreneurship cannot thrive when people cannot keep the fruits of their labor. Why build a factory if you don't know whether your neighbors or your government will simply take it from you? The poorest nations of the world lack the rule of law that protects private property.  - John Stossel"
"   Economic freedom is also key. Canada's Frazier Institute ranks countries by economic freedom. At the bottom of the list are Myanmar, Algeria, Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, and other countries dominated by government planning. Invariable, these are the worst place to live.  - John Stossel"

"God does not care…whether I am happy or not.  What God cares about, with all the power of God’s holy being, is the quality of my life…not just the continuation of my breath and the health of my cells – but the quality of my life, the scope of my life, the heft and zest of my life…fear of death always turns into fear of life, into a stingy, cautious way of living that is not really living at all…to follow Jesus means going beyond the limits of our own comfort and safety.  It means receiving our lives as gifts instead of guarding them as…possessions.  - Reverend Barbara Brown Taylor"

"There are three stages in the work of God: impossible, difficult, done.  - James Hudson Taylor"
The most important part of our task will be to tell everyone who will listen that Jesus is the only answer to the problems that are disturbing the hearts of men and nations.

"Among a large class, there seemed to be a dependence upon the government for every conceivable thing. The members of this class had little ambition to create a position for themselves, but wanted the federal officials to create one for them. How many times I wished then and have often wished since, that by some power of magic, I might remove the great bulk of these people into the country districts and plant them upon the soil – upon the solid and never deceptive foundation of Mother Nature, where all nations and races that have ever succeeded have gotten their start – a start that at first may be slow and toilsome, but one that nevertheless is real.  - Booker T.

"When I read those words [Do take him if you want some genuine experiences of inspiration, and it you want the excitement of aggrandizing a talent which is finally going to be among the most exciting and fulfilling of our time.] I felt no pressure at all, because I knew my talent was a blessing from God.  These gifts, this talent – it wasn’t me.  Yes, destiny is what we make it, but we’re helped along.  Yes, I worked hard.  Yes, I made some sacrifices until I finally made it.  Yes, luck is where opportunity meets preparation.  But first and foremost it’s a blessing from God, which is the foundation of everything.  It’s the extra push we need to take us where we’re meant to go.  It’s not just because of what Bob Stone wrote and said.  It’s not just because it was my destiny.  This man believed in me and that was huge.  He even had an agent fiend of his come to see me in Othello, so he did open doors for me.  I might not have gone through all those doors, but he held them for me.  For me.  And because he believed in me, I believed in myself.  There’s a great saying, “From those to whom much is given, much is expected.”  You hear that line a lot, but I  always think, “Well, what’s the definition of much?  Is it monetary?  Is it how many times you’re on television?  How many square feet you’ve built into your house?  How many deals you’ve closed or negotiations you’ve won?  And how much is much?  - Denzel Washington"
